# Homework-05

This repository contains an app that runs in browser and that acts as a work day scheduler.  It was made in order to continue practicing with JavaScript as well as JQuery.

The site can be reached here: [Day Planner](https://ryryp97.github.io/Homework-05/) 

Here is what the site looks like : ![Day Planner](images/day_planner.png)

### Usage

To operate on the site, just click on the text area nested within each time slot and type whatever tasks youd like to get done during that time.  Then, click the save button for that time slot to store your text data in local storage, it'll still be there even if you refresh the page!

### Credits

I'd like to thank W3Schools and many threads on Stack Overflow for their help in the creation of this website.
